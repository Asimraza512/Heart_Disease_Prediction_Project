#ğŸ©º Heart Disease Prediction App using Machine Learning
ğŸš€ Overview

This project is a Machine Learning-based Web App built with Streamlit that predicts whether a person is at high or low risk of heart disease based on various medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

The backend model is a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier trained on the Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv).
It is fully integrated with data preprocessing, feature scaling, and user-friendly input fields for real-time prediction.
